# paths.yaml — Project filesystem configuration
# ================================================================
# This file tells the project where things live on disk.
#
# Rules:
# - Keys can be renamed, expanded, or deleted as needed.
# - Values may be relative (to project root) or absolute paths.
# - "~" and environment variables ("$HOME") are allowed.
# - Directories listed here will be auto-created.
# - Nothing in this file should depend on domain-specific logic.
#
# Add any groups of paths you like (e.g., "data", "results", "external").
# These become available automatically in the context used by templates.
